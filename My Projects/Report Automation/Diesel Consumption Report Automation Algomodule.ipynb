user to move the source files into the Data backup folder and delete all source files after complete importing without unhandled failure\n","* Ask if the user wants to go back to main menu after completing import all data\n","* record any unhandled error down the error log, name of skipped file and timestamp for post-program debugging\n","\n","### Version 2.0 [30/03/2022 01:32 AM]\n","This version has been updated with the following changes\n","* Minor fine tuning\n","* Menu to operate two different operations:\n","    * Run the program\n","    * Configuration of parameters (two layer: simple & advanced)\n","* All settings are contained into a dictionary for easy save and load configuration\n","* Splitted the menu and config codes from the algorithm codes\n","* skip any file that raise unhandled error\n","\n","### Version 1.1 [22/03/2022 01:44 PM]\n","* Added progress bar for lines writen\n","* Enhanced results printing (showing successful imported files, empty files and
